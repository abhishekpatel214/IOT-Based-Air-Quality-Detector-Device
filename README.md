# IOT-Based-Air-Quality-Detector-Device
1. Arduino-Based Air Quality Detector
- use a 0 PCB board and connect all components, like an Arduino Uno, a MQ-135 air quality sensor, a 16x4 LCD display, a buzzer, and jumper wires.
2. Atmega 328p-Based Air Quality Detector Mini (Portable) Device
- used a Coper board and soldered all components, like an Atmega 328p microcontroller, an MQ-135 air quality sensor, 3 LEDs (red, green, and yellow), a buzzer, a 16.000 MHz crystal, and a 5 volt charging module.
